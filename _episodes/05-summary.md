## Where to go from here

We have now learned the essentials of Git, i.e. how to make commits,
how to work with branches, how to merge and how to resolve conflicts.

But there is more to learn, and here are additional lessons that you
can browse through on your own after the workshop:

- [Using the Git staging area](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/04-staging-area/)
  - Why do we recommend to first add, then commit a change?
  - What should be included in a single commit?
- [Undoing things](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/05-undoing/)
  - How can I undo things?
  - See when undone changes are permanently deleted and when they can be retrieved
- [Sharing repositories online](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/09-remotes/)
  - How can I set up a public repository online?
  - How can I clone a public repository to my computer?
- [Inspecting history](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/10-archeology/)
  - How can we find out who introduced a line of code and when exactly?
  - How can we find out which commit broke or changed a functionality?
- [Interupted work](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/11-interrupted/)
  - How can Git help us to deal with interrupted work and context switching?
- [Aliases and configuration](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/12-aliases/)
  - How can I remember all these Git command options?
- [Git under the hood](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/13-under-the-hood/)
  - Where are commits stored?
  - What are branches really?
- [Practical advice: how much git is necessary?](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/14-level/)
  - What level of complexity is necessary for each project?

In addition, there is a whole lot to learn about how to work collaboratively 
with other people on the same projects using Git:

- [Collaborative distributed version control](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-collaborative/)
  - How can we share repositories with others? 
  - How can we keep repositories in sync?
  - How can we collaborate with people who we might not know yet? 
  - What is a fork? 
  - What is a pull request or merge request? 
  - What is code review? 
  - How do teams collaborate on GitHub or GitLab or Bitbucket?
